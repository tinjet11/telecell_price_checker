# Battery Price Checking App

## Introduction

Hey there! This app is a game-changer for my father's business. He goes out of town to sell batteries and other products, and managing prices for over 1000 customers with different products was quite a task. Every time, he had to call or text my mom to get the price details for each customer and product. That's when I decided to put my mobile app development skills to good use and create this app!

Now, my father can easily check the price of a product for a specific customer just by typing in the company name. No more calling and waiting for information – everything he needs is right at his fingertips.

## Features

- **Instant Price Check:** With a simple input of the customer's company name, my father can instantly see the price of the product they're interested in.

- **Comprehensive Product Details:** The app doesn't just stop at prices. It also displays essential product information like names, dates, stock codes, and unit prices.

- **User-Friendly:** I made sure the app is super easy to use. No complicated steps or confusing interfaces – just straightforward access to the information he needs.

## Why I Created This

Seeing my father struggle with price inquiries motivated me to create this app. By leveraging my knowledge of mobile app development, I aimed to make his business operations smoother and more efficient. I wanted to eliminate the constant back-and-forth communication between him and my mom for something as basic as product prices.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter:** I built the app using the Flutter framework, which means it works seamlessly on both iOS and Android devices.

- **BLoC State Management:** To keep things organized and efficient, I used the BLoC pattern for managing the app's state.

- **Clean Architecture:** I followed the principles of clean architecture to keep the codebase clean and maintainable. It helps in making future updates and changes easier.

- **Back4App:** For the database, I chose Back4App as it's a reliable platform for storing and retrieving data efficiently.
